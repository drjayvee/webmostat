Web.py GUI to control my thermostat using my Raspberry PI

Purpose
-------

I have a Raspberry Pi hooked up to my heating system, which I want to control via the web.

The idea is to enable me to switch off the heater in case I forgot, or to start heating
remotely so my living room is cozy when I get home.


Setup
-----
* [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) (with WiFi) to control some electronics using GPIO
* [Web.py](http://webpy.org/) for the web interface
